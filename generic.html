							<p>I have a broad interest in up to date styles. I pride myself on creating the unique next best thing. 
								Having always had an interest in fashion, art and culture I like to think have a wide range of knowledge on artists, designers, artistic movements and more… my mother says I was born with a pencil in my hand and I always kept a keen interest in the world of media my whole life!
								
								</p>
							<p>After studying my A-levels in Art, Photography, Philosophy and Ethics I consider myself to have a broad range of talent and knowledge which are a helpful combination of skills needed to cover the broad spectrum of design which can please all audiences. Whether you like Van Gogh or Banksy we’ve got you covered. 
								As a young student I consider myself to be well researched and up to date on the new styles of the world, this in turn ensures that the work I produce is trendy but isn’t going to become yesterdays news. But also I can create designs that are classic and timeless.
							   
							   I am also interested in working on pre-existing projects, by this mean I can add a fresh new look to your brand. If you are looking to rebrand, Skelcha Design is here to help you!</p>

				<h3>So what can Skelcha Design do for you?</h3>
				<p>/></span>As you can probably tell, I am a young designer which can be useful when it comes to coming up with new and interesting concepts. I am very familiar with new trends, new designsers and new everything! That being said I am not all about following every trend that comes around because I know that trends go just as easy as they come. Skelcha Design strives to create things that won't be a flop tomorrow. After growing uo surrounded by Social Media i have become accustomed to people's differences. We live in a diverse world and Skelcha Design is no different. Our main priority is the customer and what makes <b>you</b> happy. </p>
